                    I did some work on the proposal and scrum board, updating tasks and finishing project overview with teammates. 
                    I did some more research into VR fishing and found a pretty succinct review of a game that does VR fishing well: 
                    <a class="will" href="https://youtu.be/qBn6MfZ2PRA?si=wZSBEuF1bqBdF_sH">HERE.</a> 
                    It seems that a very good method of making a game like this feel good is the pacing, controls, and sound design especially. 
                    This is good news as Peter has shared he is very interested in making good audio and haptics for the game. 
                    We still need to work on deciding on the design of the game but have to figure out more technical aspects first. 
                    We are currently bottle-necked on lack of development within the game so far. 
                    I will begin work on the project next week so that we have a base to start from.

                    Fairly uneventful given workload with other classes and this being the first blog post. 
                    Excited to get working on the final project. 
                    I set up Jira and Github so me and the guys can get to work whenever we’re ready. 
                    We mostly just solidified our plan this week so we know what we’re building. 
                    <br><br>
                    We want to make a fishing game and really flesh out the mechanics given the simplicity of the concept itself. 
                    I am heavily inspired by the fishing system in FFXV and would like to create something similar
                    <br><br>
                    Set up this blog as well for us to submit to.

                    As a group, we met last week on January 21st and another time on the 26th. 
                    The first meeting involved some initial brainstorming and setting up the bones of the design doc. 
                    After choosing to make a fishing game, we used the second meeting to further refine that idea and lay out things in preparation to work. 
                    The others set up a Jira board, GitHub repo, and a Unity project. 
                    Somehow “Trouting Around” was the best name we came up with for this game, I’m still not sure if it’ll end up as just a placeholder.
                    <br><br>
                    Personally, I added a few more tabs to our project’s Google Doc and cleaned up some formatting. 
                    A tab to collect all the due dates and rubrics together, another few for each of us to put our blog posts. 
                    I found that the most helpful thing we settled on was on how closely we wanted our game’s mechanics to follow real life. 
                    At least, we won’t abstract fishing away to the degree that Pokemon or Stardew Valley does, leaving it to a single button input. 
                    Below is a set of various possible influences for visual and mechanical design.

                    <br>While on break during last Wednesday’s class, I found an article on someone recreating the raindrop effect from Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom since we were working on particles in Unity to imitate rain. 
                    It was a pretty interesting breakdown of a good-looking and performant way of handling rain in Unity.

                Not much progress was done this week as we focused mainly on working on our 2nd assignment for this class, 
                however it was very helpful to get us back into the flow of things with regards to Unity. We also mostly 
                finished our proposal before the first milestone, so not much work needed to be done on it. The team and I 
                communicated our preferred roles to each other during our last meetup, to which I chose the role of the main 
                artist and programming.

                    For this milestone, I worked on the pitch section on the project proposal. 
                    I communicated with the team on what the game was gonna be about and we discussed preliminarily what the main goal of the game is, how it'll be played, and what we're trying to focus on specifically when it comes to user interaction. 
                    We discussed how we wanted the game to be very realistic and rewarding, to match the same feeling as if someone were actually fishing.
                    <br><br>
                    Below are some sketches I made of how I mentally interpreted the game to look like.

                <ul>This week was more of a focus on the 2nd assignment for this class for me. I learned some valuable
                    information on openXR and the different built in functionalities that it has, this will help me for
                    the later weeks when we start implementing the VR interactions. For this week we focused on
                    finishing our proposal. Choosing our roles was a little challenging for me because I feel like I can
                    fit into multiple roles. Communicating with the group to decide what role everyone was comfortable
                    with is something that should be done/will be done.</ul>
